            <img src="../img/rawon.jpg" alt="Rawon">
            <p>Rawon is a famous beef soup with a rich, dark broth. Its unique color and deep savory flavor come from the keluwek nut, a fermented nut used as the main seasoning. In Surabaya, rawon is typically served with warm rice, a handful of fresh bean sprouts, and a sprinkle of fried shallots.</p>
